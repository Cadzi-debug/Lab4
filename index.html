<h1>WELCOME TO MOBILE LEGENDS</h1>

<p>
Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (ML) is a popular 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game played on mobile devices. 
Two teams compete on the same map, and each player controls one hero with unique skills and roles. The main goal is 
to destroy the enemy base, but teams must first gain advantage by farming minions and jungle monsters for gold and 
experience. As players level up and buy items, they become stronger and can take bigger fights.
</p>

<p>
Winning in ML is not only about getting kills — it is mainly about teamwork and objectives. Players work together to 
push lanes, destroy turrets, secure important objectives like the Turtle and Lord, and control key areas of the map. 
Good communication, proper timing, and understanding roles (Tank, Fighter, Assassin, Mage, Marksman, and Support) 
help a team win more consistently. By balancing farming, fighting, and objective-taking, teams can build momentum 
and finish the game.
</p>

<h2>SKILLS</h2>

<p>
Skills are abilities that heroes use to attack, defend, or control enemies. Timing and proper skill use can decide team fights.
</p>

<h2>ROLES</h2>

<p>
Roles describe what a hero usually does in the team. Each role has a job that helps the whole team win.
</p>

<h3>Tank</h3>
<p>
Tanks protect teammates and start team fights. They absorb damage and help control the front line.
</p>

<h3>Fighter</h3>
<p>
Fighters are strong in close combat and can take more damage than most roles. They deal damage while also surviving 
longer in battles.
</p>

<h3>Assassin</h3>
<p>
Assassins eliminate enemies quickly using burst damage. They target the backline such as mages and marksmen.
</p>

<h3>Mage</h3>
<p>
Mages deal magic damage and often have crowd control skills. They help control fights and burst down enemies.
</p>

<h3>Marksman</h3>
<p>
Marksmen deal high damage, especially in the late game. They need farming and protection to become powerful.
</p>

<h3>Support</h3>
<p>
Supports help the team with healing, shields, or utility skills. They keep teammates alive and help the team during fights.
</p>

<h2>GAME PLAY</h2>

<p>
The main objective is to destroy the enemy base. Teams win by farming, taking objectives, and pushing lanes together.
